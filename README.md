    - [Express template](https://github.com/edwinhern/express-typescript-2024)

2. Set up CI/CD using the workflow examples in [CI/CD Pipeline Configuration](CI_CD.md):
    - Configure GitHub Actions for CI
    - Set up deployment workflows for CD
    - Add quality gates (tests, linting, security scans)

3. Configure environment variables following [Environment Management](ENV_MANAGEMENT.md):
    - Create `.env.example` with all required variables
    - Set up secret management for production environments
    - Document environment-specific configurations

4. Set up error tracking with Sentry as described in [Error Tracking with Sentry](SENTRY.md):
    - Configure Sentry for your application
    - Add custom error logging
    - Set up proper error boundaries and fallbacks

5. Implement feature flags following [Feature Flag Management](FEATURE_FLAGS.md):
    - Set up the feature flag service
    - Add feature flag checks to your code
    - Document feature flag lifecycle

### Contributing to Existing Projects

1. Clone the repository
2. Check the project's README.md for specific setup instructions
3. Create a feature branch following our [branching strategy](REPO_SETUP.md#branching-strategy)
4. Make your changes, ensuring they adhere to our standards
5. Create a pull request following our [PR template](REPO_SETUP.md#repository-structure)
6. Respond to code review feedback
7. After approval, merge to the appropriate branch

### Code Review Process

We believe code reviews are essential for maintaining quality and sharing knowledge. Our process includes:

1. **Automated Checks**: All PRs must pass automated CI checks before review
2. **Peer Review**: At least one peer must review the PR
3. **Tech Lead Review**: For major changes, a tech lead must also review
4. **Review SLA**: Initial reviews should be completed within 24 hours
5. **Focused Reviews**: Keep PRs small and focused to facilitate reviews

For detailed guidelines, see [Code Review Guidelines](REPO_SETUP.md#code-review-guidelines).

## Architecture Patterns

### Backend Architecture

Our backend applications follow these architectural patterns:

1. **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic encapsulated in service classes
2. **Repository Pattern**: Data access logic separated from business logic
3. **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies rather than creating them
4. **API-First Design**: APIs designed before implementation, with OpenAPI documentation
5. **Asynchronous Processing**: Heavy tasks offloaded to background workers

See [Python Development](PYTHON.md) and [Express Development](EXPRESS.md) for language-specific implementations.

### Frontend Architecture

Our frontend applications follow these architectural patterns:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: UI built from reusable components
2. **Container/Presentation Pattern**: Separation of data fetching and presentation
3. **Flux/Redux Pattern**: Unidirectional data flow for state management
4. **Server Components**: Using Next.js App Router for server-side rendering where appropriate
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

See [Next.js Development](NEXT.md) for detailed implementation guidelines.

### Microservice Architecture

For complex systems, we follow these microservice patterns:

1. **API Gateway**: Single entry point for clients
2. **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service location
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Fail fast for unavailable dependencies
4. **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous communication between services
5. **CQRS**: Separation of read and write operations

See [API Design Principles](API_DESIGN.md) for more details on service communication patterns.

## Common Patterns and Examples

Each standards document includes code examples and configuration templates. Use these as a starting point for your implementation.

### Error Handling

Consistent error handling across all applications:

1. **Structured Error Responses**: Standard JSON format for error responses
2. **Error Classification**: Classify errors into categories (validation, authentication, etc.)
3. **Contextual Information**: Include request IDs and timestamps in errors
4. **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages for users
5. **Detailed Logging**: Log full error details for debugging

See [Error Tracking with Sentry](SENTRY.md) for implementation details.

### Authentication & Authorization

Standard approaches for authentication and authorization:

1. **JWT-Based Authentication**: Standard token format and validation
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: User permissions based on roles
3. **OAuth 2.0 Integration**: For third-party authentication
4. **API Key Management**: For service-to-service communication
5. **Secure Password Storage**: Argon2 or bcrypt for password hashing

See [API Design Principles](API_DESIGN.md#authentication-and-authorization) for more details.

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) to version control
- Follow the security guidelines in [Environment Management](ENV_MANAGEMENT.md) for handling secrets
- Implement proper authentication and authorization in your applications
- Apply the principle of least privilege for all IAM roles as described in [Infrastructure as Code](IAC.md#security-best-practices)
- Conduct regular security scans and penetration testing
- Maintain dependency updates to avoid vulnerabilities
- Use content security policies and CORS protection

## Testing Standards

All projects should include:

- **Unit tests** for individual components/functions
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints and service interactions
- **End-to-end tests** for critical user flows
- **Performance tests** for key functionality
- **Security tests** to identify vulnerabilities

See the testing sections in our technology-specific guides for detailed testing approaches.

### Test Coverage Requirements

| Project Type     | Minimum Coverage | Target Coverage |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Core Services    | 80%             | 90%             |
| Internal Tools   | 70%             | 80%             |
| Frontend Apps    | 70%             | 80%             |
| Infrastructure   | 60%             | 70%             |

## Performance Standards

We maintain these performance targets for our applications:

| Metric                        | Target     |
|-------------------------------|------------|
| Time to First Byte (TTFB)     | < 200ms    |
| First Contentful Paint (FCP)  | < 1s       |
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)| < 2.5s     |
| Time to Interactive (TTI)     | < 3.5s     |
| API Response Time (95th)      | < 500ms    |
| Page Size                     | < 500KB    |

See our technology-specific guidelines for implementation details on achieving these targets.

## Documentation Requirements

All projects must include these documentation components:

1. **README.md**: Project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples
2. **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger for REST APIs, GraphQL Schema for GraphQL
3. **Code Comments**: Meaningful comments for complex functionality
4. **Architecture Diagrams**: System architecture and data flow
5. **Runbooks**: Operations and maintenance procedures

See [Documentation Standards](DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed requirements.
