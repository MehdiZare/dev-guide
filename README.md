# Development Standards

This repository houses our organization's development standards, guidelines, and best practices. These documents ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability across all our projects.

## Getting Started

New team members should:

1. Read through the standards relevant to your role/project
2. Set up your development environment following the appropriate guides
3. Review our GitHub workflow and branching strategy
4. Familiarize yourself with our CI/CD pipeline

## Standards & Guidelines

### Core Development

- [GitHub Repository Setup](REPO_SETUP.md) - Setting up and managing repositories
- [CI/CD Pipeline Configuration](CI_CD.md) - Continuous integration and deployment
- [Documentation Standards](DOCUMENTATION.md) - Code and project documentation
- [Environment Management](ENV_MANAGEMENT.md) - Managing environment variables and secrets
- [Error Tracking with Sentry](SENTRY.md) - Error monitoring and reporting

### Technology-Specific Guidelines

- [Python Development](PYTHON.md) - Python and FastAPI standards
- [Next.js Development](NEXT.md) - Next.js frontend standards
- [Express Development](EXPRESS.md) - Express.js backend standards
- [Infrastructure as Code](IAC.md) - Terraform standards

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up a New Project

1. Use the appropriate project template for your technology stack
2. Set up CI/CD using the workflow examples in [CI/CD Pipeline Configuration](CI_CD.md)
3. Configure environment variables following [Environment Management](ENV_MANAGEMENT.md)
4. Set up error tracking with Sentry as described in [Error Tracking with Sentry](SENTRY.md)

### Contributing to Existing Projects

1. Clone the repository
2. Check the project's README.md for specific setup instructions
3. Create a feature branch following our [branching strategy](REPO_SETUP.md#branching-strategy)
4. Make your changes, ensuring they adhere to our standards
5. Create a pull request following our [PR template](REPO_SETUP.md#repository-structure)

## Common Patterns and Examples

Each standards document includes code examples and configuration templates. Use these as a starting point for your implementation.

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) to version control
- Follow the security guidelines in [Environment Management](ENV_MANAGEMENT.md) for handling secrets
- Implement proper authentication and authorization in your applications
- Apply the principle of least privilege for all IAM roles as described in [Infrastructure as Code](IAC.md#security-best-practices)

## Testing Standards

All projects should include:

- Unit tests for individual components/functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints and service interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows

See the testing sections in our technology-specific guides for detailed testing approaches.

## Getting Help

If you have questions about our development standards or need clarification:

1. Check if your question is answered in the relevant standards document
2. Ask in the #dev-standards channel on Slack
3. Reach out to the appropriate tech lead for your project

## Contributing to These Standards

Our development standards evolve over time. To suggest changes:

1. Create a new branch from main
2. Make your proposed changes
3. Create a pull request with a clear explanation of the rationale for the changes
4. The architecture team will review your proposal

## Version Management

These standards are reviewed and updated quarterly. When technology versions are updated:
- Minor version updates are applied immediately
- Major version updates are scheduled with a transition period
- Legacy versions are supported for 3 months after a major version update

These standards are maintained by the Architecture & Engineering Excellence team.
