## Incident Response Overview

A well-defined incident response process is critical for minimizing the impact of production issues. After a particularly painful 6-hour outage in our payment system last year that could have been resolved in minutes with proper procedures, we've established this comprehensive framework.

## Incident Severity Levels

We classify incidents by severity to ensure appropriate response:

| Level | Name | Description | Examples | Response Time | Resolution Target |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| P1 | **Critical** | Service down or unusable with major business impact | - Payment processing failure<br>- Complete site outage<br>- Data breach | Immediate | < 2 hours |
| P2 | **Major** | Partial service disruption with significant impact | - Checkout slowness<br>- Important feature unavailable<br>- Major performance degradation | < 30 min | < 4 hours |
| P3 | **Minor** | Minor feature issues with limited impact | - Non-critical feature unavailable<br>- UI/UX bugs<br>- Isolated errors | < 2 hours | < 24 hours |
| P4 | **Low** | Cosmetic issues or improvements | - Visual glitches<br>- Minor performance issues<br>- Documentation errors | Next business day | < 1 week |

## Incident Roles and Responsibilities

For P1 and P2 incidents, we assign specific roles:

### Incident Commander (IC)

The IC coordinates the response effort:
- Declares the incident
- Assigns roles
- Makes critical decisions
- Coordinates communication
- Ensures follow-up actions

### Technical Lead

The Technical Lead directs the technical response:
- Leads troubleshooting
- Coordinates technical resources
- Makes technical decisions
- Implements or oversees fixes
- Documents technical details

### Communications Lead

The Communications Lead manages internal and external communications:
- Updates status page
- Notifies stakeholders
- Drafts customer communications
- Coordinates with support team
- Documents timeline

### Scribe

The Scribe documents all aspects of the incident:
- Maintains real-time incident log
- Records key decisions and findings
- Captures action items
- Compiles information for post-mortem
- Ensures documentation is complete

## Incident Detection

Effective detection systems help us identify issues quickly:

### Monitoring Systems

We use multiple monitoring layers:
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk usage, network
- **Application Monitoring**: Error rates, response times, request volumes
- **Business Metrics**: Conversion rates, order volumes, user signups
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: Simulated user journeys

### Alert Thresholds

Standardized alert thresholds based on service criticality:
- **Critical Services**: 99.9% availability, < 200ms response time
- **Important Services**: 99.5% availability, < 500ms response time
- **Standard Services**: 99% availability, < 1s response time

### On-Call Rotation

We maintain a 24/7 on-call rotation:
- Primary and secondary on-call engineers
- Weekly rotation schedule
- Escalation paths for each service
- Response time SLAs by severity

## Incident Response Process

### 1. Detection and Declaration

When an incident is detected:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Alert Triggered/Issue Reported] --> B{Verify Issue}
    B -->|Real Issue| C[Declare Incident]
    B -->|False Alarm| D[Document and Close]
    C --> E[Determine Severity]
    E --> F[Assign Roles]
    F --> G[Create Incident Channel]
```

1. **Alert triggered** or issue reported
2. **Verify the issue** is real and impacting users
3. **Declare the incident** in the #incidents Slack channel
4. **Determine severity** based on impact criteria
5. **Assign roles** based on severity and availability
6. **Create incident channel** (e.g., #inc-2023-04-25-payment-api)

We've found that formally declaring incidents speeds up response by 40% compared to our previous ad-hoc approach.

### 2. Investigation and Diagnosis

Steps for investigating the issue:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Gather Information] --> B[Form Hypothesis]
    B --> C[Test Hypothesis]
    C -->|Confirmed| D[Develop Solution]
    C -->|Not Confirmed| B
    D --> E[Document Findings]
```

1. **Gather information**:
    - What changed recently?
    - Which components are affected?
    - What errors are appearing?
    - When did it start?

2. **Form hypotheses** about potential causes
3. **Test hypotheses** with data and investigation
4. **Develop solution** once root cause is identified
5. **Document findings** for transparency

#### Investigation Checklist

- [ ] Review recent deployments and changes
- [ ] Check error logs and monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Verify infrastructure status (AWS, GCP, etc.)
- [ ] Check dependent service status
- [ ] Review recent configuration changes
- [ ] Analyze affected user segments

### 3. Mitigation and Resolution

Steps for resolving the incident:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Consider Temporary Mitigation] --> B{Is Mitigation Needed?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Apply Mitigation]
    B -->|No| D[Implement Full Fix]
    C --> D
    D --> E[Verify Resolution]
    E -->|Issue Persists| A
    E -->|Issue Resolved| F[Document Resolution]
```

1. **Consider temporary mitigation** to restore service:
    - Feature flags to disable problematic features
    - Rollback to previous version
    - Increase resources temporarily
    - Circuit breakers or rate limiting

2. **Implement full fix** once available
3. **Verify resolution** with monitoring and testing
4. **Document resolution** steps taken

Our rollback-vs-fix protocol saved us during a critical checkout issue when a quick rollback restored service while the team developed a proper fix.

### 4. Communication

Maintain clear communication throughout the incident:

#### Internal Communication

- Post regular updates in the incident Slack channel
- Hold brief status update calls for critical incidents
- Document current status, findings, and next steps
- Ensure all team members have a shared understanding

#### External Communication

For user-impacting incidents:

- Update status page promptly
- Prepare customer communication if needed
- Coordinate with support team
- Set realistic expectations for resolution
- Acknowledge the issue without overpromising

#### Status Updates Template

```
Incident: [Brief description]
Status: [Investigating/Mitigating/Resolved]
Time: [Current time]

What we know:
- [Facts about the incident]

What we're doing:
- [Current actions being taken]

Next update expected by:
- [Time for next update]
```

## Post-Incident Activities

### 1. Immediate Follow-up

Tasks to complete immediately after resolution:

1. **Verify stability** of the fix
2. **Document incident details** in the incident log
3. **Notify all stakeholders** of resolution
4. **Schedule post-mortem** meeting
5. **Create follow-up tickets** for any technical debt

### 2. Post-Mortem Analysis

Conduct a blameless post-mortem:

1. **Meeting**: Schedule within 2 business days
2. **Participants**: Include incident responders and stakeholders
3. **Format**: Follow structured template
4. **Documentation**: Create detailed post-mortem document
5. **Action Items**: Assign owners and deadlines

#### Post-Mortem Template
