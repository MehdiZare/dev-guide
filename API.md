This guide outlines our organization's standards for designing APIs, with a focus on creating consistent, maintainable, and developer-friendly interfaces.

> ðŸ“Œ **Return to**: [Main Development Guide](README.md)

## Core Principles

Our API design is guided by these core principles, established after evaluating what worked best across our various services:

1. **Consistency**: APIs should follow consistent patterns and conventions
2. **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, intuitive designs over complex ones
3. **Evolution**: Design for future changes without breaking existing clients
4. **Documentation**: APIs should be thoroughly documented
5. **Security**: Security should be built-in from the beginning

## API Paradigms

### REST APIs

Our primary API paradigm is REST. We've standardized on RESTful APIs for most services after our experiments with multiple paradigms led to integration challenges.

#### REST Resource Naming

- Use **nouns**, not verbs, for resource endpoints
- Use **plural nouns** for collection endpoints
- Use **kebab-case** for multi-word resource names
- Nest resources to express relationships

```
# Good
GET /users
GET /users/123
GET /users/123/orders
POST /orders

# Avoid
GET /getUsers
GET /user/123
GET /getUserOrders/123
POST /createOrder
```

#### HTTP Methods

Use standard HTTP methods appropriately:

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| GET | Retrieve resources |
| POST | Create resources |
| PUT | Replace resources completely |
| PATCH | Update resources partially |
| DELETE | Remove resources |

#### HTTP Status Codes

Use appropriate HTTP status codes:

| Code Range | Category | Common Examples |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 2xx | Success | 200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content |
| 3xx | Redirection | 301 Moved Permanently, 304 Not Modified |
| 4xx | Client Error | 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found |
| 5xx | Server Error | 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable |

We've found that consistent use of these codes significantly improves client debugging and error handling.

### GraphQL APIs

For certain complex data requirements (especially in our admin dashboards), we use GraphQL:

#### When to Use GraphQL

- When clients need flexible data querying capabilities
- For complex UIs that need to fetch many related resources
- To reduce network requests and over-fetching

#### GraphQL Guidelines

- Use descriptive type names and follow GraphQL naming conventions
- Provide clear descriptions for types, fields, and arguments
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Set up performance monitoring and query complexity analysis

```graphql
# Example Schema
type User {
  """
  Unique identifier for the user
  """
  id: ID!
  
  """
  User's full name 
  """
  name: String!
  
  """
  User's email address
  """
  email: String!
  
  """
  Orders placed by this user
  """
  orders(
    """
    Maximum number of orders to return
    """
    limit: Int = 10
  ): [Order!]!
}
```

### Lesson Learned: API Paradigm Selection

In our early days, we mixed API paradigms across services, causing developer confusion and integration challenges. After a challenging quarter of integration issues, we standardized on REST for most services, with GraphQL reserved for specific use cases where it adds clear value.

The customer portal team tried a hybrid approach initially but found it increased complexity without proportional benefits. Now we have clear criteria for when to use each paradigm.

## API Versioning

We version all public APIs to allow for evolution while maintaining backward compatibility. After several painful API migrations, we've adopted this versioning strategy:

### URL Path Versioning

Include the major version in the URL path:

```
https://api.example.com/v1/users
https://api.example.com/v2/users
```

This approach provides clear version visibility and is easy for client developers to understand.

### Versioning Rules

- Increment the major version for breaking changes
- Add new fields and endpoints without incrementing version
- Mark fields as deprecated before removing them
- Support at least one previous major version for 6 months

### API Lifecycle Management

1. **Active**: Current version, fully supported
2. **Deprecated**: Previous version(s), still supported but scheduled for removal
3. **Sunset**: End-of-life, no longer supported

When deprecating an API version:
- Announce deprecation at least 3 months in advance
- Provide migration guides and tools
- Add deprecation notices in response headers
- Monitor usage to identify clients that need to migrate

Our Auth API v1 migration taught us the importance of communicating early and providing robust migration tools. We had to extend our support window when we discovered several critical internal services hadn't been updated in time.

## Request/Response Structure

### Request Guidelines

- Use query parameters for filtering, sorting, and pagination
- Use request bodies for complex operations
- Validate all inputs with clear error messages
- Support both JSON and form-encoded requests for API flexibility

### Response Guidelines

- Use consistent response structures
- Always include proper HTTP status codes
- Provide useful error messages
- Use pagination for large collections

### JSON Response Format

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2023-11-01T12:00:00Z",
    "requestId": "abcd1234"
  }
}
```

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Email address is invalid",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "email",
        "message": "Must be a valid email address"
      }
    ]
  },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2023-11-01T12:00:00Z",
    "requestId": "abcd1234"
  }
}
```

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Methods

We support these authentication methods:

1. **API Keys**: For server-to-server communication
2. **OAuth 2.0**: For user-authorized access to resources
3. **JWT**: For stateless authentication

### Authentication Headers

```
# API Key
Authorization: ApiKey your-api-key

# OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token
Authorization: Bearer your-access-token

# JWT
Authorization: JWT your-jwt-token
```

### Authorization Approaches

- Use role-based access control (RBAC) for most APIs
- Implement resource-based permissions for complex scenarios
- Include permission checks in API documentation

## API Performance

### Optimization Techniques

- Implement appropriate caching strategies
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Support partial responses to reduce payload size
- Compress responses
- Optimize database queries

### Rate Limiting

All APIs implement rate limiting to protect from abuse:

- Include rate limit headers in responses
- Provide clear error messages when limits are exceeded
- Offer increased limits for authenticated users

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1605114594
```

## Feature Flag Integration

Our APIs integrate with our feature flag system to enable controlled rollouts and experimentation:

### Feature Flag Headers

Clients can specify feature flags in requests:

```
X-Feature-Flags: new-pricing-engine,beta-recommendations
```

### Feature Flag Response Indicators

APIs indicate which features were applied:

```json
{
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "features": {
      "new-pricing-engine": true,
      "beta-recommendations": false
    }
  }
}
```

## API Documentation

### Documentation Requirements

All APIs must include:

1. **OpenAPI/Swagger Specification**: Machine-readable API definition
2. **Endpoint Documentation**: Purpose, parameters, responses
3. **Authentication Documentation**: How to authenticate
4. **Example Requests/Responses**: For all endpoints
5. **Error Documentation**: Error codes and handling
6. **Changelog**: History of changes

### Documentation Tools

We use these tools for API documentation:

- **SwaggerUI/ReDoc**: For interactive API documentation
- **Postman Collections**: For API testing and sharing

### Example-Driven Documentation

Our documentation follows an example-driven approach with both curl examples and language-specific examples for our supported client libraries.

## Monitoring and Observability

All APIs must implement:

1. **Request Logging**: Log all API requests
2. **Error Tracking**: Track and alert on API errors
3. **Performance Metrics**: Monitor response times
4. **Usage Analytics**: Track API usage patterns

We've integrated these with our central observability platform to provide consistent monitoring across all services.

## Client Libraries

For widely-used APIs, we provide official client libraries:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Java
- Go

Each client library follows these principles:

- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full API coverage
- Clear documentation
- Type safety where applicable

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Internationalization

- Support language preferences via the `Accept-Language` header
- Return translated error messages where appropriate
- Use UTF-8 encoding for all text

### Timezones

- Store and transmit all timestamps in UTC
- Use ISO 8601 format for all dates and times
- Allow clients to specify timezone preferences

### Compliance and Privacy

- Include necessary compliance headers
- Respect privacy settings in responses
- Document data retention policies

## Lessons Learned from Production

### Case Study: The Payment API Evolution

When we first launched our payment processing API, we made several mistakes:

1. Inconsistent response formats between endpoints
2. No versioning strategy
3. Insufficient error details
4. Limited documentation

After receiving feedback from frustrating integration experiences, we:

1. Standardized all responses
2. Implemented proper versioning
3. Enhanced error responses with actionable details
4. Created comprehensive documentation with examples

These changes reduced integration support tickets by 72% and significantly improved developer satisfaction.

### Case Study: GraphQL Performance Issues

Our initial GraphQL implementation for the dashboard API suffered from performance issues due to:

1. Unbounded queries leading to excessive database load
2. No query complexity analysis
3. Insufficient caching

After addressing these issues by implementing query complexity limits, DataLoader patterns, and appropriate caching, we reduced average query time by 85% and significantly improved dashboard performance.
